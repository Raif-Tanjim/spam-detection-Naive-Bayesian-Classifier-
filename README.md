# spam-detection-Naive-Bayesian-Classifier-
it is spam [text,message] detection program using the help of Naive Bayesian Classifier
 we import a data sheet of spam messages
 we  split the data using train test [20% test data]
 we take the train datas and create a bag of word using the CountVectorizer function
 we then convert the bag of words [train data] into arrays
 we then train the model using the train datas and test the model
 {at then we see a simpler version of the code using sklear pipeline :) }
